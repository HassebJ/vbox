            <p>VBOX is free and we don’t charge anything. We don't charge private sellers or businesses 
                anything for using our services. However we charge businesses  a small amount for using 
                just our video/audio calling and receiving services. Other services of chatting are still 
                free such as text chatting, file & location sharing and appointments etc. There are no 
                charges for creating accounts or business profile either. But businesses need to funds to 
                their accounts for using just the the video/audio chatting services their credit/debit cards, 
                Paypal and Stripe account information while creating business profile. Charges for video/audio 
                calls are per minutes if there are no funds in the account they will be asked to purchase or 
                fund for using video/audio servies otherwise they won’t be able to make or recieve calls.
